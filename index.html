    <h3><b>Current Projects</b></h3>
    <ul>
      <li>As of January 2021, I am working with the U-M Physics Department's Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Committee, U-M's Society of Physics Students, and the Jalen Rose Leadership Academy (JRLA) in Detroit, MI to connect undergraduate volunteers with understaffed high school physics classes.
      <br />
      <br />
      <li>Volunteers are tasked with helping students work through their classroom activities; such as virtual simulations using "PHET Interactive Simulations" provided by the University of Colorado Boulder.
      <br />
      <br />
      <li>Additionally, I am working with these organizations in partnership with U-M's recruiting offices to launch a program where JRLA students can visit U-M's Ann Arbor campus and shadow a physics student or faculty member; starting this Fall 2021 semester. This shadowing program aims at demonstrating to eager high school students what studying and researching physics at the college level can look like.
      <br />
      <br />
      <li>I am very passionate about creating inclusive learning environments; starting from the ground up. The COVID-19 Pandemic has brought my in-person commitments to serving high school students to the virtual domain and since mid 2020 I have been creating free and accesible workshops aimed at empowering and educating students around the nation; available in both Spanish and English.
      <br />
      <br />
      <li>With JRLA specifically, I plan on bringing my informative presentations to non-graduating students regarding course selection that will best prepare them for their intended major, breaking down the college application process, and more.

      <li>Working with teachers at the Jalen Rose Leadership Academy to supplement their freshman physics course with demonstration kits made at the University of Michigan. This involves bringing in undergradute volunteers to virtually assist discussion sections. 15-minute short research talks have been planned to begin in January 2021 so that students can be exposed to the various areas of physics research available.</li>
      <li>Preparing for the TEAM-UP <a href="https://www.aip.org/teamupworkshops">APS directed workshops</a> aimed at incresing African American student representation at the undergraduate level drastically in the coming years.</li>
      <li>Efforts to begin a student exchange program with HBCU's are underway and a definitive update is soon to come.</li>

      <h2 style="color:#18aecc;">About Me</h2>
      <hr style="width:200px" class="w3-opacity">
      <!-- EDIT THIS SECTION TO CHANGE YOUR ABOUT ME -->
      <p> Hello! My name is Kevin Zvonarek. I am a third-year at the University of Michigan currently pursuing a Physics and Mathematics major through the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts.
      <p> Given that I come from an immigrant family I make sure to create bilingual content so that all of my information is accesible.
      I have been tutoring for 5 years in subjects ranging from standardized tests (ACT, SAT, PSAT) to AP/IB courses.
      My virtual drop-in rooms act as an office hour where students in middle school and high school can come to discuss topics such as: applying to college, working while in school, establishing sustainable and healthy lifestyles, personal finance, etc.
      <br />
      <br />
      <p> Podcasts I am currently listen to include: "Eigenbros" with Juan and Terence and "HumanAIn" with David Yakobovitch
      <p> On weekends I can be found catching up on SNL Skits, "The Daily Show" with Trevor Noah, and watching the latest episode of "Last Week Tonight" with John Oliver.
      <p> A good friend of mine recently introduced me to the author Tim James. I am reading through his latest novels "Astronomical" and "Fundamental".
      <p> I always make time to exercise at my nearby reservoir and practice speedcubing. Pre-pandemic you would have found me traveling between both coasts and exploring SoCal with my girlfriend and her younger brother.
